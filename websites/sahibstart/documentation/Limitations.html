       <p>
        Though I have worked very hard to overcome limitations, but there are still a few limitations.
           <br />
           Project Limitations are mentioned below:
           
           
           <ol>
               <li>Slow Yelp Api - The Api's working is very slow, so it takes time to render results.
               </li>
   
              <li>Yelp Reviews are only brief excerpts. The YELP Api does not provide complete reviews of Yelp Users</li>
               <li>Following Users' comments and likes' dont mention the name of each user.</li>
               
           </ol>
        </p>
