    <p>
        This week I was basically working on setting up the essential files and designing my home page.
        I have also worked on the responsive design web pages.
        <br /> <br />
        I have demonstrated experiments on :
        <p>   1. Responsive Text
            <br />
              2. Responsive Images
            <br />
              3. Responsive SideBars
            <br />
              4. Responsive Content
            <br />
              5. Selected Responsive Divs
            <br />
            <br />
