    <p>
        I have finally been able to complete my project.
        It has been a great learning experience for me.<br />
        </p>
        <p>I would like to thank the TAs and my Professors for all the guidance and assistance provided throughout the course.<br />
        There were quite a few difficulties faced while incorporating functionalities in the project.<br />

        The LIKE, COMMENT and FOLLOW functionalities were the most interesting ones<br />
        I had developed in my food related social networking site "OMNOMNOM" (Hope you like the name, HAHA)<br />

    <p>
        This course got me to learn technologies that I had barely even heard of.<br />
        Techologies like AJAX, JSON, C#, JAVASCRIPT, jQuery were exciting to work on.
        <br />
        <br />
        All in all, this course has been particularly awesome, and I am proud of<br />
        the kind of project I have developed!! :D
